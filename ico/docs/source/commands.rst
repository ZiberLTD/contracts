Introduction
============

Here are listed command line commands.

All commands read `populus.json` file for the chain configuration from the current working directory. The chain configuration should set up a Web3 HTTP provider how command line command talks to an Ethereum node. The Ethereum node must have an address with ETH balance for the operations.

deploy-presale
==============

A presale contract is a contract to collect presale investor money to be moved to a crowdsale when the crowdsale opens. The cresale contract can be deployed through ``presale`` command. After deploying the investors can call its ``invest()`` and ``refund()`` function from any Ethereum wallet allowing the transaction ``data`` field set.

.. code-block :: console

    presale --help

::

    Usage: presale [OPTIONS]

    Options:
      --chain TEXT     On which chain to deploy
      --address TEXT   Account to deploy from (must exist on geth)
      --days INTEGER   How many days presale is frozen for
      --minimum FLOAT  What is the minimum pre-ico buy in (ether)
      --help           Show this message and exit.

Example that deploys an immediately refundable (-1 days to refund) presale contract for testing on the mainnet.

.. code-block :: console

    deploy-presale --address=0x8888888888888888888 --days=-1 --minimum=0.001

.. _deploy-token:

deploy-token
============

Deploy a crowdsale token contract.

::

    Usage: deploy-token [OPTIONS]

      Deploy a CrowdsaleToken contract.

      Example:

      deploy-token --chain=ropsten
      --address=0x3c2d4e5eae8c4a31ccc56075b5fd81307b1627c6 --name="MikkoToken
      2.0" --symbol=MOO --release-
      agent=0x3c2d4e5eae8c4a31ccc56075b5fd81307b1627c6  --supply=100000

    Options:
      --chain TEXT          On which chain to deploy - see populus.json
      --address TEXT        Address to deploy from and who becomes as a owner
                            (must exist on geth)  [required]
      --release-agent TEXT  Address that acts as a release agent (can be same as
                            owner)
      --minting-agent TEXT  Address that acts as a minting agent (can be same as
                            owner)
      --name TEXT           How many days presale is frozen for  [required]
      --symbol TEXT         What is the minimum pre-ico buy in (ether)  [required]
      --supply INTEGER      What is the minimum pre-ico buy in (ether)
      --help                Show this message and exit.


Example that deploys a crowdsale token to testnet and then sets the owner as a release agent:

.. code-block:: console

    deploy-token --chain=ropsten --address=0x3c2d4e5eae8c4a31ccc56075b5fd81307b1627c6 --name="MikkoToken 2.0" --symbol=MOO --release-agent=0x3c2d4e5eae8c4a31ccc56075b5fd81307b1627c6  --supply=100000
